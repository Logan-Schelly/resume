I started as a lower division tutor and left as the head upper division tutor.

Helped students on a first-come-first-served basis with
College Algebra,
Trigonometry,
Differential and Integral Calculus,
Introductory Proofs,
Linear Algebra,
Multivariable Calculus, and
Differential Equations.
I would teach at least 3 exam reviews each semester.

As the head upper division tutor, I had additional responsibilities.
I organized weekly tutor training meetings for upper division tutors, 
coordinated exam reviews for each midterm exam,
and reported directly to the Math Lab Administrator.
