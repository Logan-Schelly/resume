# What is This?

Hello folks!  This is the git repository where I'm keeping my resume.

### Why would you use git for your resume?

2 reasons:
1. I've noticed that I usually end up tweaking my resume a bit each time I apply for a job.
Often times these tweaks are not permanent, so I create a one-off version for the company.
Sometimes I end up incorporating the tweaks into my master version.
I've noticed that this will clutter my file system with different versions of my resume.
It seemed like version control would be well suited for these small tweaks while removing file system clutter.
2. Sometimes people make recommendations on how to fix my resume.
A fork or branch of this repository might make those changes easier to communicate.
Or, they could simply open up an [issue on github](https://github.com/Logan-Schelly/resume/issues).
